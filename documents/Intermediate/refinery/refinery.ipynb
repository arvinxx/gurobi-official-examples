    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "An oil refinery purchases two types of crude oil (Crude 1 and Crude 2) and refines them through a four-step process (distillation, reforming, cracking, and blending) to produce gas and fuels that are sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step One: Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "The distillation process separates each crude oil into six fractions according to their boiling points. These fractions are: light naphtha, medium naphtha, heavy naphtha, light oil, heavy oil, and residuum. The octane numbers for the light, medium and heavy naphthas are, respectively, 90, 80, and 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "One barrel of crude separates into following fractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Light Naphta | Medium Naphta | Heavy Naphta | Light Oil | Heavy Oil | Residuum |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Crude 1 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.12 | 0.2 | 0.13 |\n",
    "| Crude 2 | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.18 | 0.08 | 0.19 | 0.12 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a small amount of waste in distillation (5% and 3% for Crude 1 and 2, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Two: Reforming\n",
    "\n",
    "After distillation, the resulting naphthas can be blended into different grades of gas, or they can go through a process called reforming. The output of the reforming process is a product known as reformed gasoline with an octane number of 115.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yields of reformed gasoline from each barrel of the different naphthas are given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One barrel of light naphtha yields 0.6 barrels of reformed gasoline.\n",
    "- One barrel of medium naphtha yields 0.52 barrels of reformed gasoline.\n",
    "- One barrel of heavy naphtha yields 0.45 barrels of reformed gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Three: Cracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Light and heavy oils can be blended into jet fuel or be put through a process known as catalytic cracking. The catalytic cracker produces cracked oil and cracked gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cracked gasoline has an octane number of 105 with the following yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One barrel of light oil yields 0.68 barrels of cracked oil and 0.28 barrels of cracked gasoline.\n",
    "- One barrel of heavy oil yields 0.75 barrels of cracked oil and 0.2 barrels of cracked gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cracked oil is used for blending fuel oil and jet fuel; cracked gasoline is used for blending gasoline. Residuum can be used for either producing lube-oil or blending into jet fuel and fuel oil:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One barrel of residuum yields 0.5 barrels of lube-oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Four: Blending\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gasoline\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of gasoline — regular and premium — made by blending naphtha, reformed gasoline, and cracked gasoline. The only requirement is that regular gasoline must have an octane of at least 84 and premium gasoline must have an octane number of at least 94. It is assumed that octane numbers blend linearly by volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jet Fuel\n",
    "\n",
    "Jet fuel must have a vapor pressure that does not exceed $1.0 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{cm}^2}$. The vapor pressures for light, heavy, cracked oils and residuum are, respectively, 1.0, 0.6, 1.5 and 0.05 $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{cm}^2}$. It is assumed that vapor pressures blend linearly by volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fuel Oil\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce fuel oil, you must blend light oil, cracked oil, heavy oil and residuum in the ratio of 10:4:3:1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The availability and capacity limitations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The daily availability of crude 1 is 20 000 barrels.\n",
    "- The daily availability of crude 2 is 30 000 barrels.\n",
    "- At most 45 000 barrels of crude can be distilled per day.\n",
    "- At most 10 000 barrels of naphtha can be reformed per day.\n",
    "- At most 8000 barrels of oil can be cracked per day.\n",
    "- The daily production of lube oil must be between 500 and 1000 barrels.\n",
    "- Premium gasoline production must be at least 40% of regular gasoline production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each final product has the following profit contribution per barrel (pennies per barrel):\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Profit Contribution |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Premium Gasoline | 700 |\n",
    "| Regular Gasoline | 600 |\n",
    "| Jet Fuel | 400 |\n",
    "| Fuel Oil | 350 |\n",
    "| Lube Oil | 150 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question is: How should the operations of the refinery be planned in order to maximize total profit?\n",
