    "## Motivation\n",
    "The Technician Routing and Scheduling (TRS) is a common problem faced by telecommunication firms, which must be able to provide services for a large number of customers. With its limited resources, these firms must try to deliver timely, affordable and reliable services to maximize customer satisfaction. The TRS problem involves assignment, scheduling, and routing of multi-skilled technicians to serve customers with unique priorities, service time windows, processing times, skills requirements, and geographical locations. \n",
    "In the current practice, these decisions are often being made by operators via heuristics, sometimes manually -and this method\n",
    "can not only be time-consuming, \n",
    "but may also deviate from optima significantly. \n",
    "Using mathematical optimization to solve the\n",
    "TRS problem  will\n",
    "enable \n",
    "telecom operators and dispatchers to automate and improve their assignment, scheduling, and routing decisions, while achieving high customer satisfaction."

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "A telecom firm operates multiple service centers to serve its customers. \n",
    "Each service center has \n",
    "its technicians who are dispatched from the service center to work on their assigned jobs, and return to the center after all the jobs are completed. \n",
    "A technician has multiple skills and available working capacity that cannot be exceeded during the scheduling horizon. \n",
    "A service order/job has \n",
    "a known processing time, \n",
    "a customer-specified time window for starting the service, \n",
    "a deadline of completing the service, \n",
    "and its skill requirements. \n",
    "Depending on the nature of the job (routine maintenance or emergency), and relationship with the customer (existing, new), the firm assesses the importance of the job and assigns a priority score to it. \n",
    "A job is assigned to at most one technician who possesses the required \n",
    "skills, \n",
    "but the technician's available capacity during the scheduling horizon cannot be exceeded.\n",
    "To solve the  TRS problem, telecommunications companies must be able to\n",
    "simultaneously makes three types of decisions: (i) the assignment of jobs to a technician at all the service centers; \n",
    "(ii) the routing of each technician, i.e. the sequence/order of customers for a technician to visit; \n",
    "(iii) and the scheduling of jobs, i.e. the timing for a technician to arrive at a customer location and complete the corresponding job. \n",
    "The firm’s goal is to minimize the total weighted lateness of all  jobs, with their priority being the weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following constraints must be satisfied:\n",
    "* A technician, if utilized, departs from the service center where he/she is based and returns to the same service center after his/her assigned jobs are completed.\n",
    "* A technician’s available capacity during the scheduling horizon cannot be exceeded.\n",
    "* A job, if selected, is assigned to at most one technician who  possesses the required skills.\n",
    "* A technician must arrive at a customer location during an interval (time window) specified by the customer, and must complete a job before the deadline required by the customer. This an important constraint for guaranteeing customer satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above basic TRS is a variant of the multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows, known as the MDVRPTW in the literature [1]. \n"

    "Mathematical programming is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates a mathematical optimization model that captures the key aspects of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi Optimizer solves such models using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",

Recall that the value of the paramter $M$ is a large number, then the penalty associated with not filling a job is determined as follows: $\\pi_{j} \\cdot M$.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we formulated and solved a multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows constraints using the Gurobi Python API. This MIP formulation is an optimization application for the telecommunication industry; however, the formulation is quite general and can easily be adapted to any kind of vehicle routing problems in the transportation and logistics industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routing and scheduling problem that we tackled considers a telecom firm that operates multiple service centers to serve its customers. We solved this routing and scheduling problem by simultaneously making three types of decisions: \n",
    "- (i) the assignment of jobs to a technician at all the service centers\n",
    "- (ii) the routing of each technician, i.e. the sequence/order of customers for a technician to visit\n",
    "- (iii) the scheduling of jobs, i.e. the timing for a technician to arrive at a customer location and complete the corresponding job. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the telecom firm is to minimize the total weighted lateness of all the jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we discussed two scenarios, the base scenario has enough technicians' capacity to fill all customers demand on time. In scenario 1, we reduced the capacity of all technicians by half, and one customer has an emergency that requires service first thing in the morning. The scenario captures various trade-offs that the MIP model needs to consider given the limited technician capacity and customers' job priority and requirements."
