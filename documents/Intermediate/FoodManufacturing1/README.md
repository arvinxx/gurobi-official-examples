# Food Manufacture I

This model is an example of a blending problem. In blending optimization problems, multiple raw materials are combined
in a way the meets the stated constraints for the lowest cost.

More information on this type of model can be found in example #1 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in
Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 253-254 and 296-298.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with the
Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.
