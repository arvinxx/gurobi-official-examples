    "This model is an extension of the supply network design problem considered in example 19. Given a set of factories, depots, and customers, the goal of this example is to determine which depots to open in order to minimize overall costs. This extenstion allows the possibility to close some depots and open new ones.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we have six end customers, each with a known demand for a product.  Customer demand can be satisfied from a set of six depots, or directly from a set of two factories.  Each depot can support a maximum volume of product moving through it, and each factory can produce a maximum amount of product.  There are known costs associated with transporting the product, from a factory to a depot, from a depot to a customer, or from a factory directly to a customer. This extension provides the opportunity to choose which four of the six possible depots to open.  It also provides an option of expanding capacity at one specific depot.\n",
