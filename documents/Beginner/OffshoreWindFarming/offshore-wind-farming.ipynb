    "全球气候变化已经对环境产生了明显影响。冰川消退，河流和湖泊上的冰块破裂早于预期，动植物物种受到影响，树木开花快于预期。全球气候变化的潜在未来影响包括更频繁的山货，某些地区更长的干旱时期以及热带风暴的数量，持续时间和强度增加。[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "缓解气候变化包括限制全球变暖的幅度或速度及其相关影响的行动。缓解气候变化的第一个挑战是消除煤炭，石油和最终天然气的燃烧。这可能是最艰巨的挑战，因为富裕国家的居民吃饭、穿衣、工作、娱乐甚至睡觉都离不开化石燃料。同样，发展中国家的人民也希望且也应该得到同样的生活。目前对于减少对化石燃料的依赖，并没有完美的解决方案（例如，碳中性生物燃料会抬高食品价格并导致森林破坏；核能虽然不会排放温室气体，但会产生放射性废物）。其他替代品还包括植物衍生的塑料，生物柴油和风力发电等。\n",
    "\n",
    "海上风力发电是利用风力发电场建造在水体中，通常是在海洋中，以收集风能来发电。与陆地相比，海上的风速更高，因此海上风力发电的单位装机容量更高。\n",
    "\n",
    "将风力涡轮机安装在海上的好处是，沿海地区的风力要强得多，与大陆上的风力不同，下午的海上微风可能很强劲，与人们用电最多的时间相称。海上涡轮机也可以靠近沿海地区（例如大城市）的负载中心，从而无需新的长距离传输线。\n"

    "海上风电场是一组放置在海上的风力涡轮机，以利用强大的海上风力。这些强风可以产生更多的电力，但海上风力发电场的安装和运营成本比陆地上的要高。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们将使用MIP模型来减少建造海上风电场的部分成本。我们将计算出如何铺设连接涡轮机的水下电缆的计划。这些电缆是将涡轮机产生的电力输送到陆地所必需的。我们计算的计划将使安装水下电缆的成本降到最低，同时确保每个涡轮机都与海岸相连，每根电缆都有足够的容量来处理产生的电流。\n",
    "\n",
    "在我们的例子中，丹麦西海岸正在建设一个风力发电场。海岸上有一座发电站，所有的电力都必须被输送到电网中。风电场中还设有中转站，可以收集来自多个涡轮机的电力，并通过一条电缆将其传送到岸上。\n",
    "\n",
    "在安装电缆时，我们必须考虑两个因素。首先，在海底铺设电缆是有固定成本的。这种成本与电缆连接的两个站点之间的距离成正比。第二，我们必须考虑有多少电流会通过电缆。承载大电流的连接需要厚电缆。粗电缆比细电缆贵。\n",
