    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of facility location problems -also known as location analysis [1]- is a branch of operations research and computational geometry concerned with the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and the location of  competitors' facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fermat-Weber problem, formulated in the 17'th century, was one of the first facility location problems ever proposed. \n",
    "The Fermat-Weber problem can be described as follows: Given three points in a plane, find a fourth point such that the sum of its distances to the three given points is minimal. This problem can be interpreted as a version of the facility location problem, where the assumption is made that the transportation costs per distance are the same for all destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facility location problems have applications in a wide variety of industries. For supply chain management and logistics, this problem  can be used to find the optimal location for stores, factories, warehouses, etc. Other applications range from public policy (e.g. positioning  police officers in a city), telecommunications (e.g. cell towers in a network), and even particle physics (e.g. separation distance between repulsive charges). Another application of the facility location problem is to determine the locations for natural gas transmission equipment. Finally, facility location problems can be applied to cluster analysis."

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A large supermarket chain in the UK needs to build warehouses for a set of supermarkets it is opening in Northern England. The locations of the supermarkets have been decided, but the locations of the warehouses have yet to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several good candidate locations for the warehouses have been identified, but decisions must be made regarding \n",
    "how many warehouses to open and at which candidate locations to build them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening many warehouses would be advantageous as this would reduce the average distance a truck has to drive from the warehouse to the supermarket, and hence reduce the delivery cost. However, opening a warehouse has a fixed cost associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, our goal is to find the optimal tradeoff between delivery cost and the cost of building new facilities."

    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical programming is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates a mathematical optimization model that captures the key aspects of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi Optimizer solves such models using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical optimization model has five components, namely:\n",

    "* Sets and indices.\n",
    "* Parameters.\n",
    "* Decision variables.\n",
    "* Objective function(s).\n",
    "* Constraints.\n",

    "### Sets and Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "$i \\in I$: Index and set of supermarket (or customer) locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$j \\in J$: Index and set of candidate warehouse (or facility) locations.\n",

    "\n",
    "$f_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$: Fixed cost associated with constructing facility $j \\in J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$: Distance between facility $j \\in J$ and customer $i \\in I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$: Cost of shipping between candidate facility site $j \\in J$ and customer location $i \\in I$. We assume that this cost is proportional to the distance between the facility and the customer. That is, $c_{i,j} = \\alpha \\cdot d_{i,j}$, where $\\alpha$ is the cost per mile of driving, adjusted to incorporate the average number of trips a delivery truck would be expected to make over a five year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$select_{j} \\in \\{0, 1 \\}$: This variable is equal to 1 if we build a facility at candidate location $j \\in J$; and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 \\leq assign_{i,j} \\leq 1$: This non-negative continuous variable determines the fraction of supply received by customer $i \\in I$ from facility $j \\in J$.\n",

    "### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total costs**. We want to minimize the total cost to open and operate the facilities. This is the sum of the cost of opening facilities and the cost related to shipping between facilities and customers. This total cost measures the tradeoff between the cost of building a new facility and the total delivery cost over a five year period.\n",
