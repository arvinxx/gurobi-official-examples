    "In this example, we will model and solve a multi-period production planning problem. In this case, the purpose of the application is to optimize the operation of a farm over five years. The farmer has a certain number of farmable acres and cows. The cows can be sold or used to produce milk, which can also be sold for profit. Food for the cows is grown on the farmable acres. The aim is to create an optimal operational plan for the next five years to maximize the total profit of the farm. \n",
    "This includes determining optimal strategies for cultivation, for managing the cows, and for the overall operation of the farm\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A farmer with a 200-acre farm wishes to create a five-year production plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, he has a herd of 120 cows comprising 20 heifers (young female cows) and 100 adult dairy cows. Each heifer requires 2/3 of an acre to support it and each dairy cow requires one acre.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, a dairy cow produces 1.1 calves per year. Half of these calves will be bullocks that are sold shortly after birth for an average of $\\$30$ each. The remaining calves, heifers, can either be sold for $\\$40$ or raised until age two when they will become dairy cows. For the current year, all heifers identified for sale have already been sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general practice is to sell all dairy cows at the age of 12 for an average of $\\$120$ each. However, each year an average of $5\\%$ of heifers and $2\\%$ of dairy cows die. At present, the farmer’s herd of 120 cows is evenly distributed with 10 cows per age from newborn to 11 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "The milk from a dairy cow can be sold for $\\$370$ annually. The farmer can currently house up to 130 cows, but this capacity limit can be increased for $\\$200$ per additional cow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dairy cow requires 0.6 tons of grain and 0.7 tons of sugar beet per year. Both of these can be grown on the farm. Each acre can yield 1.5 tons of sugar beet. However, only 80 acres are suitable for growing grain, and those acres have different levels of productivity as follows:\n",

    "| Group 1 | 20 | 1.10 |\n",

    "| Group 3 | 20 | 0.80 |\n",
    "| Group 4 | 10 | 0.65 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sugar beet can be bought for $\\$70$ a ton and sold for $\\$58$ a ton. Grain can be bought for $\\$90$ a ton and sold for $\\$75$ a ton.\n",
    "\n",
    "The annual labor requirements for cows as well as grain and sugar beet production are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Labor Required (Hr/Year) |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Heifer | 10 |\n",
    "| Milk-producing Cow | 42 |\n",
    "| Acre Devoted to Grain | 4 |\n",
    "| Acre Devoted to Sugar Beet| 14 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Other annual costs are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Cost (USD/Year) |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Heifer | 50 |\n",
    "| Milk-producing Cow | 100 |\n",
    "| Acre Devoted to Grain | 15 |\n",
    "| Acre Devoted to Sugar Beet| 10 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Labor currently costs the farmer $\\$4000$ per year and that cost provides 5,500 hours of labor. Additional labor can be paid for at the rate of $\\$1.20$ per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any capital expenditure can be financed with a 10-year loan at $15\\%$ interest annually. The interest and principal are paid back in 10 equal annual payments. It is prohibited for the annual cash flow to be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The farmer does not want to reduce the total number of dairy cows at the end of the five-year period by more than $50\\%$, nor does he want to increase their number by more than $75\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What plan should the farmer follow over the next five years in order to maximize profit?\n",
