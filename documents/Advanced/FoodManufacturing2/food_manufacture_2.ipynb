    "## Objective and Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Both this model and Food Manufacture I are examples of blending problems. In blending optimization problems, multiple raw materials are combined in a way the meets the stated constraints for the lowest cost. These problems are common in numerous industries including the oil industry (blending different types of crude oil at a refinery) and agriculture (manufacturing feed that meets the different nutritional requirements of different animals).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, we will model and solve a production planning problem where we must create a final product from a number of ingredients â€” each of which has different costs, restrictions, and features. The aim is to create an optimal multi-period production plan that maximizes profit. More details can be found on the Problem Description and Model Formulation  below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to Food Manufacturing I, this example has additional constraints that change the problem type from a linear program (LP) to a mixed-integer program (MIP), making it harder to solve. You can see these additional constraints at the end of the Problem Description section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on this type of model can be found in example #2 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 255 and 299-300.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A manufacturer needs to refine several raw oils and blend them together to produce a given food product that can be sold. The raw oils needed can be divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category        | Oil         |\n",
    "| ------------- |-------------| \n",
    "| Vegetable oils:|  VEG 1<br>VEG 2 | \n",
    "| Non-vegetable oils:     | OIL 1<br>OIL 2<br>OIL 3      |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The manufacturer can choose to buy raw oils for the current month and/or buy them on the futures market for delivery in a subsequent month. Prices for immediate delivery and in the futures market are given below in USD/ton:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Month |\tVEG 1 |\tVEG 2 |\tOIL 1 |\tOIL 2 |\tOIL 3|\n",
    "| ------------- |-------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------| \n",

    "| February |130 |\t130 |\t110 |\t90|\t115|\n",
    "| March |110 |\t140 |\t130 |\t100 |\t95|\n",
    "| April |120 |\t110 |\t120 |\t120 |\t125|\n",
    "| May | 100 |\t120 |\t150 |\t110 |\t105|\n",
    "| June |  \t90 |\t100 |\t140 |\t80| \t135 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of additional factors that must be taken into account. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The final food product sells for $\\$150$ per ton.\n",
    "2. Each category of oil (vegetable and non-vegetable) needs to be refined on a different production line.\n",
    "3. There is limited refinement capacity such that in any given month a maximum of 200 tons of vegetable oils and 250 tons of non-vegetable oils can be refined.\n",
    "4. Also, there is no waste in the refinement process, so the sum of the raw oils refined will equal the amount of refined oils available.\n",
    "5. The cost of refining the oils may be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the refining limits above, there are limits to the amount of raw oils that can be stored for future use, and there is a cost associated with each ton of oil stored. The limit is 1,000 tons of each raw oil and the storage cost is $\\$5$ per ton per month. The manufacturer cannot store the produced food product or the refined oils.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final food product must have a hardness between three and six on a given hardness scale. For the purposes of the model, hardness blends linearly and the hardness of each raw oil is:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Oils |\tHardness|\n",
    "| ------------- |-------------| \n",
    "|VEG 1 |\t8.8|\n",
    "|VEG 2 |\t6.1|\n",
    "|OIL 1 |\t2.0|\n",
    "|OIL2 |\t4.2|\n",
    "|OIL 3| \t5.0|\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of January, there are 500 tons of each type of raw oil in storage. For the purpose of the model, this should also be the level of raw oils in storage at the end of June.\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of the Food Manufacture problem adds the following additional constraints to the first version:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Condition 1: If an oil is used during a month, the minimum quantity used must be 20 tons.\n",
    "- Condition 2: The maximum number of oils used in a month is three.\n",
    "- Condition 3: The use of VEG1 or VEG2 in a given month requires the use of OIL3 in that same month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above information, what monthly buying and manufacturing decisions should be made in order to maximize profit?\n",
