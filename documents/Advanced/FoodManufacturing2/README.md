# Food Manufacture II

This model extends the Food Manufacture I example above to include new constraints that change the problem from a fairly
easy to solve linear programming model to an mixed integer model that is harder to solve.

More information on this type of model can be found in example #2 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in
Mathematical Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 255 and 299-300.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that
you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or
constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
