### Manpower Planning
This model is an example of a staffing problem. In staffing planning problems, choices must be made regarding the 
recruitment, training, redundancy (retention) and scheduling of staff.

More information on this type of model can be found in example #5 of the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical 
Programming, by H. Paul Williams on pages 256-257 and 303-304.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and 
that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function 
and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
