    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will model and solve a manpower planning problem. We have three types of workers with different skills levels. For each year in the planning horizon, the forecasted number of required workers with specific skills is given. It is possible to recruit new people, train workers to improve their skills, or shift them to a part-time working arrangement. The aim is to create an optimal multi-period operation plan that achieves one of the following two objectives: minimizing the total number of layoffs over the whole horizon or minimizing total costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on this type of model can be found in example #5 of the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on pages 256-257 and 303-304.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you have  advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A company is changing how it runs its business, and therefore its staffing needs are expected to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the purchase of new machinery, it is expected that there will be less need for unskilled labor and more need for skilled and semi-skilled labor. In addition, a lower sales forecast ⁠— driven by an economic slowdown that is predicted to happen in the next year ⁠— is expected to further reduce labor needs across all categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecast for labor needs over the next three years is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Unskilled | Semi-skilled | Skilled |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Current Strength | 2000 | 1500 | 1000 |\n",
    "| Year 1 | 1000 | 1400 | 1000 |\n",
    "| Year 2 | 500 | 2000 | 1500 |\n",
    "| Year 3 | 0 | 2500 | 2000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The company needs to determine the following for each of the next three years:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recruitment\n",
    "- Retraining\n",
    "- Layoffs (redundancy)\n",
    "- Part-time vs. full-time employees\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that labor is subject to a certain level of natural attrition each year. The rate of attrition is relatively high in the first year after a new employee is hired and relatively low in subsequent years. The expected attrition rates are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Unskilled (%)| Semi-skilled (%) | Skilled (%) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| $< 1$ year of service | 25 | 20 | 10 |\n",

    "\n",
    "Each year, it is possible to hire a limited number of employees in each classification from outside the company as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Unskilled | Semi-skilled | Skilled |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 500 | 800 | 500 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, it is possible to train up to 200 unskilled workers to make them into semi-skilled workers. This training costs the company $\\$400$ per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is possible train semi-skilled workers to make them into skilled workers. However, this number can not exceed 25% of the current skilled labor force and this training costs $\\$500$ per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, downgrading workers to a lower skill level can be done. However, 50% of the downgraded workers will leave the company, increasing the natural attrition rate described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each laid-off worker is entitled to a separation payment at the rate of $\\$200$ per unskilled worker and $\\$500$ per semi-skilled or skilled worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Excess Employees\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to have workers in excess of the actual number needed, up to 150 workers in total in any given year, but this will result in the following additional cost per excess employee per year.\n",
