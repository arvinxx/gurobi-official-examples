    "\n",
    "This model is an example of a supply network design problem. Given a set of factories, depots, and customers, the goal is to determine how to satisfy customer demand while minimizing shipping costs. This problem can be regarded as one of finding the minimum cost flow through a network.\n",

    "This model is example 19 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on pages 273-275 and 330-332.\n",

    "In this problem, we have six end customers, each with a known demand for a product.  Customer demand can be satisfied from a set of four depots, or directly from a set of two factories.  Each depot can support a maximum volume of product moving through it, and each factory can produce a maximum amount of product.  There are known costs associated with transporting the product, from a factory to a depot, from a depot to a customer, or from a factory directly to a customer.\n",
