    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of marketing in the banking and financial services industry is to offer \"the right product to the right customer at the right time\". However, \n",
    "actually being able to achieve this goal is a complicated and challenging undertaking. What makes this particularly difficult is that companies have multiple products and operate under a complex set of business constraints. Choosing which products to offer to which customers in order to maximize the marketing return on investment and satisfy the business constraints is enormously complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a major bank  that has made a deliberate effort to become a customer-focused institution, as opposed to a vertical product driven company. The goal of the bank is \"to be the best at helping customers become financially better off by providing relevant solutions to their unique needs\". A direct consequence of this goal is that marketing campaigns are multiple product campaigns as opposed to single product campaigns. \n",
    "This transforms the data science and campaign targeting process from a fairly simple application of individual response models into a significantly more complex process that invloves  choosing which product to offer to which customer and through which channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing team of the bank are used to applying business rules to target customers directly. \n",
    "For example, \n",
    "they target \n",
    "customers solely on their product gaps or on marketers' business intuition. \n",
    "The bank's\n",
    "marketers have also applied RFM type analysis where general recency, frequency, and monetary measurements as well as product gaps are used to target customers for specific offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing team's current approach, which \n",
    "is widely used, \n",
    "relies on predictive response models to target customers for offers. These models estimate the probability that a customer will respond to a specific offer and can significantly increase the response rate to a product offering. However, simply knowing a customer's probability of responding to a particular offer is not enough when a company has several products to promote and other business constraints to consider in its marketing planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, marketing teams also face the problem of knowing which product to offer to a customer, not just which customer to offer a product. In practice, many ad hoc rules are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* prioritization rules based on response rates or estimated expected profitability measures\n",
    "\n",
    "* business rules to prioritize products that can be marketed\n",
    "\n",
    "* product response models to select customers for a particular campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach that is easily implemented but may not produce optimal customer contact plans relies on a measure of expected offer profitability to choose which products to offer customers. However, a shortcoming of this approach is its inability to effectively handle complex constraints on the customer contact plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this marketing campaign optimization problem, M. D. Cohen [1] proposed a MIP approach with data from Scotiabank. The marketing campaign optimization problem considered eleven unique offers: five investment, three lending, and three day-to-day banking offers. The investment offers included Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), mutual funds, Registered Education Savings Program (RESP) and two unique discount brokerage offers. The lending offers included a mortgage and two credit card offers. \n",
    "The day-to-day banking offers included one of two Scotia online banking service offers and a deposit account acquisition. The term campaign is used here to imply one large pro-active customer contact campaign that is comprised of eleven distinct offers; it can be thought of as eleven single product campaigns that are being offered at generally the same time to a non-overlapping set of customers. Approximately 2.5 million customers were included in the potential target market for the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we will use this MIP approach to address the bankâ€™s marketing campaign optimization problem. It should be noted that this approach could be used by virtually any company across various industries to optimize their marketing campaigns, while taking into account their business constraints. \n"

    "The bank's marketing team needs to determine what products to offer to each customer in a way that maximizes the marketing campaign return on investment while considering the following constraints: \n",
    "\n",

    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical programming is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates a mathematical optimization model that captures the key aspects of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi Optimizer solves such models using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical optimization model has five components, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sets and indices.\n",
    "* Parameters.\n",
    "* Decision variables.\n",
    "* Objective function(s).\n",
    "* Constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now present a MIP approach for this marketing campaign optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIP solution approach proposed by Cohen [1] is an improvement over the \n",
    "traditional myopic\n",
    "approach of picking the customers that have the largest expected value for a particular product because it\n",
    "produces a globally optimal solution \n",
    "from the viewpoint of the bank and allows for the effective implementation of business constraints across customers and business units. The approach accounts for limited resources and other business constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the estimates for customer/offer expected incremental profit, costs, and business constraints serve as inputs to the marketing campaign optimization approach. The optimization phase is independent of the construction of these inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MIP approach\n",
    "involves \n",
    "a tactical and an operational problem. \n",
    "For the tactical problem, we aggregate customers based on the individual expected profit parameters.  The estimated individual expected profit can be determined with data science techniques such as predictive response models. The key idea is to cluster the estimated individual expected profits and then consider the cluster centroids as representative of the data for all the individual customers within a single cluster. This aggregation enables the problem to be formulated as a linear programming problem so that rather than assigning offers to individual customers, the model identifies proportions within each cluster for each product offer that maximizes the marketing campaign return on investment while considering the business constraints. Typically, the number of customers in a cluster will be in the hundreds of thousands, which is the main decision variable of the tactical problem, consequently these variables can be considered as a continuous; therefore, the linear programming approach is justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operational problem can be formulated as a MIP model, where the estimated individual expected profits and the output of the tactical model can be used as inputs to assign *products offers* to individual customers of each cluster in such a way that the  total marketing campaign return on investment is maximized."

Then, $y_{k,j_1}$ and $y_{k,j_2}$ of customers in cluster $k$ must be offered product $j_1$ and $j_2$, respectively.

    "Each customer got, at most, one product offer. Products p1 and p2 are offerred to at least two customers. The cost of assigning  products to customers is $\\$600$, which is equal to the total budget available. The total customers profit is $\\$6,000$. The  ROI is 1,000 %, which is much higher than the minimum ROI required.\n",

    "##  Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we discussed the importance of marketing campaigns for the banking industry. We discussed that machine learning predictive response models can be used to provide the input data of a marketing campaign optimization problem. We showed how the marketing campaign optimization problem can be decomposed into a tactical problem and an operational problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tactical problem is formulated as a linear programming problem where we aggregate data generated by the machine learning predictive response models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the tactical problem determines what products to offer to customers in clusters while maximizing the marketing campaign expected profits and considering the following constraints: \n",
    "\n",
    "* limits on funding available for the campaign.\n",
    "* restrictions on the minimum number of product offers that can be made in a campaign.\n",
    "* campaign return-on-investment hurdle rates that must be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operational problem is formulated as a MIP model, where the expected customer  profits and the output of the tactical model can be used as inputs to assign products offers to individual customers in such way that the total customers profit is maximized. We considered two cases for the operational problem. In the first case, the total available budget determined by tactical problem is not enforced. This means that the optimal solution of this problem might have slight violations of the total available budget. In the second case, we enforce a total available budget.\n"
