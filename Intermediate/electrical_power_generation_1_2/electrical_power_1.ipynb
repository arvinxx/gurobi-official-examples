    "\n",
    "This model is an example of an electrical power generation problem (also known as a unit commitment problem). It selects an optimal set of power stations to turn on in order to satisfy anticipated power demand over a 24-hour time horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is example 15 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on pages 270-271 and 325-326.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is of intermediate difficulty; we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you have some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, power generation units are grouped into three distinct types, with different characteristics for each type (power output, cost per megawatt hour, startup cost, etc.).  A unit can be on or off, with a startup cost associated with transitioning from off to on, and power output that can fall anywhere between a specified minimum and maximum value when the unit is on.  A 24-hour time horizon is divided into 5 discrete time periods, each with an expected total power demand.  The model decides which units to turn on, and when, in order to satisfy demand for each time period.  The model also captures a reserve requirement, where the selected power plants must be capable of increasing their output, while still respecting their maximum output, in order to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of generators is available to satisfy power demand for the following day.  Anticipated demand is as follows:\n",

    "| Time Period | Demand (megawatts) |\n",

    "| 3 pm to 6 pm | 40000 |\n",
    "| 6 pm to 12 pm | 27000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are grouped into three types, with the following minimum and maximum output for each type (when they are on):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Number available | Minimum output (MW) | Maximum output (MW) |\n",

    "| 1 | 10 | 1250 | 1750 |\n",
    "| 2 | 5 | 1500 | 4000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are costs associated with using a generator: a cost per hour when the generator is on (and generating its minimum output), a cost per megawatt hour above its minimum, and a startup cost for turning a generator on:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Cost per hour (when on) | Cost per MWh above minimum | Startup cost |\n",

    "Generators must meet predicted demand, but they must also have sufficient reserve capacity to be able to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand.  For this model, the set of selected generators must be able to produce as much as 115% of predicted demand.\n",
