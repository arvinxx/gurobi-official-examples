### Refinery
This model is an example of a production problem. In production planning problems, choices must be made regarding the 
what resources to use to produce what products.

More information on this type of model can be found in example # 6 of the fifth edition of Modeling Building in Mathematical 
Programming by H. P. Williams on pages 258 and 306-310.

This modeling example is at the intermediate level, where we assume that you know Python and are familiar with the 
Gurobi Python API. In addition, you should have some knowledge about building mathematical optimization models.
